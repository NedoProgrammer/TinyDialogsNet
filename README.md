# TinyDialogsNet
A C# wrapper around [tinyfiledialog](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs).

# Why?
I felt like rewritting the test file provided in the tinyfiledialog repo, so I did just that.

# What does it have?
Currently it has a:
- Beeper
- Input box
- NotifyPopup
- SaveFileDialog
- OpenFileDialog
- SelectFolderDialog
- ColorChooser

# Is it platform dependant?
Yes. There are no Any CPU configurations, because tinyfiledialog only ships with x64 and x32 versions.

# Why are there only DLLs?
I currently didn't add support for Linux since I don't have a working machine at the moment. Stay tuned, I probably will implement it soon!

# Will there be a NuGet package?
Maybe, maybe not. I'm not sure.

### more coming soon!
