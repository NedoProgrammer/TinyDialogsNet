# TinyDialogsNet
A C# wrapper around [tinyfiledialog](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs).

# Why?
I felt like rewritting the test file provided in the tinyfiledialog repo, so I did just that.

# What does it have?
Currently it has a:
- Beeper
- Input box
- NotifyPopup
- SaveFileDialog
- OpenFileDialog
- SelectFolderDialog
- ColorChooser

# Is it platform dependant?
Yes, but you can still use the AnyCPU configuration.

# Supported OSes
- Windows (x86/x64)
- Linux (soon!)
- MacOS (soon!)

# Is there a NuGet package?
[Yes!](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TinyDialogsNet/)

### more coming soon!
